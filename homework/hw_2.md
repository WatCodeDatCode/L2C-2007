## Exercise 5
Modify the Exercise 4 so that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum.

> **Example:**<br />
> User inputs `17`<br />
> Output:<br />
> `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 60`


## Exercise 6
Modify Exercise 4 so that the program asks the user for a number `n` and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum or computing the product of 1 to n.


## Exercise 7
Write a program that check wether a number exists inside an array of numbers.
```
let n = 5;
let numbers = [4, 7, 10, 12, 1, 8, 20];
// for this case the result would be false
```


## Exercise 8
Write a program that prints **1 per line** only the names on odd positions in an array of names.
```
let names = [“Josie”, “Cathrin”, “Bob”, “Max”, “Hannah”, “Alex”];
```


## Exercise 9
Write a program that prints the name with more characters in an array of names.
